### Unsupervised Object Detection

Our project aims to achieve considerable amount of accuracy in detecting location of objects in an image without being trained explicitly labelled dataset. The baseline model is SPAIR (the paper "Spatially Invariant Unsupervised Object Detection with Convolutional Neural
Networks") and some improvements are done on top of it.
